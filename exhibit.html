                            At an extraordinary historical moment,
                            Wayne Thiebaud proposed a radical new
                            take on painting, and he did so with a slice of
                            pie. This exhibition invites viewers to trace
                            Thiebaud’s emergence as a mature artist
                            with a singular style. The first exhibition to
                            explore this formative period, Wayne
                            Thiebaud | 1958–1968 brings together more
                            than 60 early paintings gathered from
                            private collections and museums
                            throughout the United States.
